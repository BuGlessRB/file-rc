Motivation

`file-rc' does a lot of work every time it runs.  It seems that part
of it can be done ahead of time and saved in a cache file to save time.
Unfortunately, the current version takes a while to make the cache file.

Also, optimization of start and stop commands is inhibited when the
config file is changed.  This makes sure that the runlevels will have
the correct runlevel configuration.

new versions of programs and test scripts that make it easy to test
configuration lockfile handling which are in an tar - gzip'ed file at:
