This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of an alternate rc.d
file handling.

This package was originally put together by Tom Lees
<tom@lpsg.demon.co.uk>, than taken over by Martin Schulze
<joey@debian.org> and now by Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>,
from sources obtained from a posting to debian-devel.

The original package (named r2d2) was written by Winfried Truemper
<winni@xpilot.org>.  It was available in the past on
ftp://ftp.guug.de/pub/members/truemper/r2d2/ but the upstream project
seems no longer to exist.
