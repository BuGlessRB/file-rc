  * Get rid of "echo -e" in rc, rclink2file.sh and update-rc.d, because
    this seem to be incompatible to POSIX.
  * Get rid of "echo -n" in update-rc.d because this is not fully
    portable.
  * Get rid of all "echo -n" in rc except one (which outputs dots to show,

    if this fails, it only looks ugly).

  * Upgrade to Standards version 3.1.0: Added Build-Depends

    - Add #DEBHELPER# to [post|pre][inst|rm] scripts.
  * Added a debian/TODO.
  * Wait for 120 seconds in rc if lockfile exists.  After this die on a

  * Lock runlevel.conf, if prevlevel!=N and new runlevel!=1,6.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Sep 1999 19:03:09 +0200

  * Changed debian/rules to debhelper.
  * Changed standards-version to 2.5.1 (no changes).
  * Conflict with ash (<< 0.3.5-1), so update-rc.d and rclink2file.sh can
    use /bin/sh (older versions of ash had a bug in ${parameter%%word},
    new ash and bash have no problem with this).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Aug 1999 17:57:25 +0200

file-rc (0.4.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * update-rd.d: Don't change runlevel.conf, if there is already a line
    with the actual command in it. This didn't work under all
    circumstances before (Closes: #31729).
  * Remove bashisms from debian/rules.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Aug 1999 18:22:44 +0200

file-rc (0.4.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer.
  * Upgraded standards-version to 2.5.0 (no changes).
  * Changed lock file consistently to /etc/runlevel.lock (should be on
    root partition).
  * Added Copyright to debian/copyright.
  * Fixed r2d2 URL in debian/copyright (Closes: #38675).
  * Run update-rc.d with /bin/bash, because there are still some bashisms
    in it (Closes: #37510).
  * Removed bashisms in all shell scripts. So at least rc and rcS can run
    with sh linked to ash. update-rc.d still needs bash because of #37510.
    (Closes: #35570, #36851, #36889 ).

file-rc (0.4.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Execution of .sh scripts now takes place in a separate environment of
    the current shell using the "(. *.sh)" construct.  This allows .sh
    scripts to use exit statements without halting the complete boot
    procedure.  (closes: Bug#28204)

 -- Martin Schulze <joey@finlandia.infodrom.north.de>  Thu, 22 Oct 1998 12:31:46 +0200

file-rc (0.4.5) unstable; urgency=low

    <Marc.Haber@gmx.de> (closes: Bug#28066)

file-rc (0.4.3) unstable frozen; urgency=high

  * Complete rewrite of the commandline parser for update-rc.d.  It now
    handles different runlevels correctly and works similar to the program
    as provided by sysvinit.
  * Included support for runlevel S (closes: Bug#19507)
  * Wrote and included rcS
  * Moved /etc/init.d/reboot and /etc/init.d/halt from sequence 05 to 99

    an interim maintainer. (closes: Bug#19310)
  * Applied patch from Wakko Warner <wakko@ani.animx.ml.org> to support
    .sh files. (closes: Bug#17882)

  * Hacked support for runlevel S into rcfile2link.sh
  * Removed /tmp files in favour of /etc tempfiles
  * Added support for runlevel S in rclink2file.sh
  * Added support for .sh files not marked executable
  * Modified /etc/init.d/rc to call all kill scripts first and then run
    the start scripts, when they're not called in the previous level -
    just like sysvinit.  (closes: Bug#20963)
  * New description
  * Added module to correct missing runlevel S support and wrong handling
    for reboot and halt to postinst
  * New Standards-Version
  * Heavy tested the code on a plain hamm machine as well as on a manual
    crippled machine.  Yes, it works.  Great.

    ending with a dot.  (Bug#12661)
