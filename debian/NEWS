file-rc (0.8.13) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * file-rc now uses LSB dependency information for obtaining the
    sequence numbers and runlevels when running update-rc.d, rather
    than using hardcoded static ordering.  This has a number of
    implications:
    - The ordering of the scripts is based upon the dependency
      information, and if a package is installed or removed, this can
      result in the sequence numbers for the scripts to be recomputed.
    - This means that the sequence numbers and runlevels in
      /etc/runlevel.conf will be rewritten and will not preserve
      manual changes made by the admin.  Editing the numbers in this
      file no longer makes sense: if these values need to be changed,
      edit the LSB header in the init script and run
        update-rc.d scriptname defaults
      to regenerate the file with the correct numbers.
    - On upgrade, the existing configuration will be replaced by
      numbers obtained from the output of insserv -s.  "insserv -s" is
      used to obtain all script dependency information.
